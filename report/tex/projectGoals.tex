\unnumberedSection[goal]{Project Goals}
The goal of this project is to develop a multiplayer game called \textit{Bomb Hunt}. In this game, the users will incarnate a gladiator trying to make its way into a labyrinth to find and defeat its opponents to accumulate points. In addition to the multi player mode, the player will also have the opportunity to play the game on a single player mode where the goal will be to survive as long as possible by resisting to different waves of ennemies spawning. A tutorial mode will also be developed to make the introduction of the game and its different components much easier to the inexperienced users. A more in-depth description of the game concept is available in the section \nameref{sec:concept}.
