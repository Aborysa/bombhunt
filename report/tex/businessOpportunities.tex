Nowadays, mobile applications are not seen as something really extraordinary anymore. Their easy accessibility by the end-users joint to the rapidity of their development and deployment have lead to the creation of countless number of them, especially games. It is harder and harder to find new game concept that will be completely different as something that already exists somewhere else. Nevertheless, some games are still able to stand out themselves in this ocean of pastime. \\

Most of these outstanding games have somewhat the following set of features:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Easy to learn and use
  \item Nice graphics and animations
  \item Can be played for 1 minute or hours
  \item Have some real challenges involved
  \item Constantly requests the attention of the user (fast gameplay)
\end{itemize}

With our concept, we think that most of these elements have been reunited, but having those is not necessarily a direct way to success and the only way to know it will be when the game will have been published. On the other hand, creating mobile games is still considered as an open market comparatively to console games development where only few giant companies have sufficient money and staff to try their chance. Overall, the team does not expect to get money out of this project, but, since they are obliged to develop this game, they will make their best to have a nice final product that \textbf{may} lead to some returns through advertisements.
