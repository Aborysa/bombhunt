\unnumberedSection[document]{Document Description}
In this document, we will first remind what is the game concept and the goals of the project (\nameref{chap:vision}). By after,
design and implementation details of the final product will be disclosed (\nameref{chap:productDetails}). In this chapter, the whole architecture will be divided in main components that we will introduce using the corresponding part of the class diagram. In the following chapter, a \nameref{chap:userManual} explaining how to install and use the game is made available. Regarding \nameref{chap:testReport}, this chapter will de dedicated to the assessing of the functional and quality requirements. Finally, a listing of the inconsistencies between the architecture and the implementation will be dressed and justifications for those inconsistencies will be provided to help stakeholders understand the \nameref{chap:relationshipsArchitecture}. \\

As usual, a list of the \nameref{chap:issues} and a log of the \nameref{chap:changes} brought to the current document will be available at the end of the document.  \\

Techniques and notations used in this document follow recommendations of \cite{bass2013} and \cite{larman2005}. The 4+1 framework by \cite{4plus1} has also been considered during the redaction of this document. By applying this framework, we make sure that a complete and thorough documentation of the architecture is done.
