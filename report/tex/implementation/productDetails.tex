\unnumberedChapter[productDetails]{Product Details}

In this chapter, we will firstly disclose the extends of the \nameref{sec:scopeReduction} that had to be done in order to deliver on time. The reasoning behind the prioritized and postponed features will also be provided. In the next section, an overview of the game \nameref{sec:designDetails} explaining how the different components interacts together and how the selected patterns serve the architecture will be done. The last section, \nameref{sec:implementationDetails}, will show how the design details just introduced have finally been implemented. In this same section, corresponding parts of the class diagram and implemented class descriptions will be used to support the discussion.
