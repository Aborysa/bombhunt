\unnumberedSection[document]{Document Description}
In this document, we will first remind what is the game concept and the goals of the project (\nameref{chap:vision}). By after, the \glspl{asr} that are going to guide the game architecture will be identified (\nameref{chap:asr}). Then, we will provide a description of the project's \nameref{chap:stakeholders} together with a justification relatively to the \nameref{chap:viewpoints} views that we made to satisfy their needs. The following chapters will explain with more details the differents \nameref{chap:tactics} and \nameref{chap:patterns} that will be applied during the development of the application. Finally, the different \nameref{chap:views} that will visually summarize the information will be presented. A discussion of the \nameref{chap:consistency} will disclose any incoherence that may have been induced by the views. \\

As usual, a list of the \nameref{chap:issues} and a log of the \nameref{chap:changes} brought to the current document will be available at the end of the document.  \\

Techniques and notations used in this document follow recommendations of \cite{bass2013} and \cite{larman2005}. The 4+1 framework by \cite{4plus1} has also been considered during the redaction of this document. By applying this framework, we make sure that a complete and thorough documentation of the architecture is done.
