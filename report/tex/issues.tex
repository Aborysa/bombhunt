\unnumberedChapter[issues]{Issues}
Before starting this project, we had a few ideas of what issues might arise during this project.

\subsection{Graphics}
We have no graphical experience within the group, and as we look at other mobile games, it becomes apparent that a simple graphical look is something we wish to achieve during this project. This is to make the game more appealing to the users.

\subsection{peer-to-peer connection}
Since we rely on peer-to-peer to transfer the data between devices, we might encounter problems with devices that are unstable. How we will we handle bad devices potentially crashing game sessions and ruining the experience for other players.
