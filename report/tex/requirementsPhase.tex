\unnumberedSection[reqPhase]{Requirement Phase}
The first phase of this project is the requirements phase. The main objective of this phase is the creation of specification document which will serves as a guideline for the following phases. Different aspects of the project will be analyzed during this phase such as the goals, the scope and the market positioning of the desired product. A list of functional requirements and \glspl{qa} that should be fulfilled by the application will be established in order to precisely define the agreement between the different stakeholders. Moreover, a list of constraint and issues will be dressed so that their impact will be foreseen and the risk to face them minimized. Once all these information will have been gathered, it will be possible to identify the \glspl{asr} specific to the application. \cite[Chapter 16]{bass2013}
