\unnumberedSection[reqPhase]{Requirement Phase}
The main objective of the requirement phase is the creation of a specification document which will serve as a guideline for the following phases. Different aspects of the project will be analyzed during this phase such as the goals, the scope and the market positioning of the desired product. A list of functional requirements and \glspl{qa} that should be fulfilled by the application will be established in order to precisely define the agreement between the different stakeholders. Moreover, a list of constraints and issues will be addressed so that their impact can be foreseen and their risk minimized. Once all this information has been gathered, it will be possible to identify the \glspl{asr} specific to the application. \cite[Chapter 16]{bass2013}
