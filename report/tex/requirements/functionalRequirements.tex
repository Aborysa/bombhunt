\unnumberedChapter[funcReq]{Functional Requirements}

In this chapter, an exhaustive list of all the functional requirements will be established. For each requirement, an unique ID, a description and a prioritization measure will be identified. The priority measure will be based on the \gls{moscow} technique \cite{brennan2009} \footnote{Nomenclature used: M - Must Have, S - Should Have, C - Could Have, and W - Won't have}. The unique ID will only be used for easy referencing and task splitting accros the development team. \\

First things first, the \autoref{fig:useCaseModel} presents the use case diagram that provides the main functionalities that the game should have. This diagram is at the center of the different functional requirements that will be enumerated below. From the figure, we can identify 5 categories of use cases \footnote{Those categories are not explicitly illustrated on the \autoref{fig:useCaseModel}.}:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Deployment (D)
  \item Gameplay (P)
  \item Statistics Tracking (T)
  \item Game Setting (S)
  \item Licensing and Attribution (L)
\end{itemize}
Those categories will be used to refine and group together related functional requirements.
