\section{Design Patterns}

\subsection{Singleton}
One of the design patterns we plan to use for the game, is the singleton pattern \cite{wiki:singleton}. This pattern will help us when we want to create a class that we want to guarantee at most one instance off is running at a time. It will also help us with classes where we keep a lot of game-wide configuration and information that might want to be accessed. Using it we won't have to pass references to objects around, creating a lot of redundant coding and software that is harder to write tests for.

\subsection{Observer}
This pattern is used when we want some Observer \cite{wiki:observer} to subscribe to something, and get alerted when the subscribed objects call some alert() function at the Observer. This could potentially be used to alert some game manager that a player has run out of lives, reducing the amount of code needed to be written for the observer. Looping through a bunch of entities and checking their values one by one, instead of just being notified when a value has been achieved, would be quite heavy on the resource side of the game, and in general create very messy code.
