\textit{[NAME OF THE GAME TO CHANGE]} is developed for a very diverse clientele of any age and culture wishing to have some good moments during their spare times independently of their location. The main aspect of the game that we think will make it different from the other games available or variants of the \textit{Bomberman} concept is the real-time interaction between the different users. Instead of trying to create any kind of sophisticated \gls{ai}, users will have to compete against each others. Another trilling aspect is the tracking of the user statistics that will allow them to unlock achievements badges and the ranking of the users. We will also develop the game in such a way that the addition of new contents and features will be easy to perform. This modifiability will allow us to keep the active users interested in the game and to have new things to exploit and discover along their play time. We must however keep in mind that the vast majority of our customers will probably be aged from 6 to 18 years old.
