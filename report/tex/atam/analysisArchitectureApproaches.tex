Availability will be about detecting and preventing faults, as well as be able to recover from them.

\unnumberedSection[scenarioOne]{Scenario one}
Scenario: Detect and recover from player losing connection.\
Attribute: Availability\
Environment: Normal operations\
Stimulus: One player loses connection\
Response: Return to main menu with an error message that the opponent is disconnected\

Architectual decisions: (1) ping echo, (2) peer-to-peer connection

Sensitivity:\
(1): s1\

tradeoff:\
(2): t1

risk:\
(1): r1


Reasoning:\
Ping echo ensure that the game participants will know when a user is no longer connecter to the game

peer-to-peer will ensure that the only connected players can do the ping directly at participants, reducing the need for a server to notify it for you.


\unnumberedSection[scenarioTwo]{Scenario two}
Scenario: Detecting players' game state out of sync, and recovery.\
Attribute: Availability\
Environment: Normal operations\
Stimulus: One player's game state update isn't notified to other participants.\
Response: Use game state that was last accepted by both devices.\

Architectual decisions: (1) peer-to-peer connection, (2) State resynchronisation

Sensitivity:\
(1): s2\

tradeoff:\
(1) t1\
(2) t2\

risk:\
(2): r2\

reasoning:\
peer-to-peer connection will create a channel for where the clients can share their latest accepted game state.

State resynchronisation will assure the clients that the state they're using, is the latest agreed game state, so that nobody will play on a different game state than their oponent.
