  \item[R1\label{r1}] Ping/Echo can introduce unnecessary complexity
  \item[N1\label{n1}] The \gls{p2p} connection can be handled by the Google Play Games Services.
  \item[R2\label{r2}] State resynchronisation will be hard to implement
  \item[R3\label{r3}] Have to be careful on deletion of the blocks to avoid observer to alert deleted bricks
  \item[R4\label{r4}] May restrict the flexibility in the gameplay
\end{description}

We chose this scenario because we think that the proposed solution to the problem can be to much work to implement for an infrequent scenario. If the connectivity between clients is handled by Google, we can would suggest to make connectivity measures low priority and trust Google with the network availability.
