\section{Architectural Patterns}

	\subsection{Entity-Component-System}
	Entity–component–system (ECS) is an architectural pattern that is mostly used in game development. An ECS follows the Composition over inheritance principle that allows greater flexibility in defining entities. \Todo{wikipedia ref} 
	Every game objects is represented by an entity. Each entity is composed of several components and the logic of these components is contained in systems.
	
	\subsection{Peer-to-Peer}
	Peer-to-peer (P2P) computing or networking is a distributed application architecture that partitions tasks or workloads between peers. Peers are equally privileged, equipotent participants in the application.
	The Google Play Games Services is used to set up a P2P connection between players. Once the connection is made, the game clients synchronize the game state between each other.
