\unnumberedSection[scope]{Project Scope}
The \textit{Bomb Hunt} will be developed in the context of the group project for the course \textsc{TDT4240 Software Architecture}. The project will be lead by a team of 4 developers that will work part-time for the next 3 months. The best case scenario would have been to find an artist to optimize the aesthetic part of the application. \\

The application should minimally work on any Android platform that has the necessary utilities to download and execute \gls{apk} files. Even if this project is mainly dedicated to educational purposes and bounded to a learning context, the team members would like to officially publish the game and maintain it after the end of the semester.
